    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1.5 cups of bittersweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated white sugar</li>

        <li>4 large eggs</li>

        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    
        
    <h4>Cookie Dough Layer</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature or almost melted</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbls milk or cream (or Bailey's)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup miniature chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Prepare the brownie layer</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, 
            then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and 
            comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.</li>
        <li>In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on 
            top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt 
            butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk 
            in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into 
            the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared 
            pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through 
            (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies 
            in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature 
            and add the cookie dough layer later)</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Prepare the cookie dough layer</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until 
            soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes).</li>
        <li>Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. 
            I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your 
            hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For 
            easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill 
            until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days)</li>
    </ol>
